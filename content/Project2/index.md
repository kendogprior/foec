### St James' Church Gates

In April 2017 the Friends of East Cowes painted and repaired the gates and lamp at the entrance to St James' churchyard. Years of rust and old paint were removed and a new coat was applied. The lamp was re-glazed&nbsp;making it a fine&nbsp;welcome for visitors to the church.
