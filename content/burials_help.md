 Burial locations in Kingston cemetery are defined by a grave section using letters A to F and and a grave number for that section.  Grave sections are plots within the cemetery and a diagram is required to see where that section is (shown below).  A more detailed picture of the plot section showing grave locations can be seen by opening one of the plot links shown beneath the image.

  {{< header4 heading = "Data Table of Deceased in Kingston Cemetery">}}

  The details of those buried in Kingston cemetery are not easily accessible to the general public but have been acquired and recorded on behalf of the Friends of East Cowes by Margaret Prior, one of its members. It has taken years to amass this data and transfer it to a computer in the form of a data table. At the time of creating this page of the site (October 2021) there are 4,681 entries in the table. The data has been sorted into surname order using software but this is required each time new data is added.
