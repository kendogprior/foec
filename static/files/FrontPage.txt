<h1 style="text-align: center;">WHO ARE THE FRIENDS OF EAST COWES?&nbsp; WHAT DO WE DO?</h1> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">A "Friends of East Cowes Cemetery" group was suggested by Margaret Lloyd and set up as a community organisation in 2006, changing its name to "Friends of East Cowes" in 2007 on completion of the Lottery-funded Old Kingston Cemetery project.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of us live in East Cowes and we all care about the town: we want to make it an even better place in which to live.&nbsp; And we don't just talk: we are ready to roll up our sleeves and carry out small projects to improve the quality of life for everyone.&nbsp;</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">We've planted trees, picked up litter and gone for walks, looking at the Town with fresh eyes to see what other practical improvements we can make.&nbsp; We can't tackle larger works, that's for the Town and County Councils and even the town centre developers, but we apply for small grants to cover the cost of materials and equipment for our projects.&nbsp; We have lots of ideas for the future.&nbsp;</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">"Can anyone join in?"&nbsp; Of course! Anyone can lend a hand, young or not so young, helping for a single morning or coming along regularly to plan and carry out new projects.&nbsp; You won't need special skills, just focus on the things that interest you.&nbsp; So, if you prefer planting bulbs to mixing cement, that's fine.&nbsp; If you can use a computer, take good photos or make a bird box, great.&nbsp; Otherwise just lend a hand!&nbsp;</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">We usually meet up one evening a month at East Cowes Heritage Centre to update and plan activities, and on the morning of the first Sunday of each month we carry out "tidy-ups" at Old Kingston Cemetery.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">The FRIENDS of EAST COWES Committee:</p> <p style="text-align: left;">KEN WHEELER (Chair): Ken moved to the Island in 2003 from Northampton.&nbsp; After being made redundant from an Island printing firm he now works from home in the same field and produces most of the Friends' printed material.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">MARGARET PRIOR (Secretary): Margaret moved to the Isle of Wight&nbsp; from Essex in 1993 and moved to East Cowes in 1999.
